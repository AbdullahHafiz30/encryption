hello this is an Encryption/Decryption and hashing program.

to encrypt a file, you need to change the directory of the input and the output files in the code first

===============================================================================================

File Encryption
1. create a text file in the directory you picked and name it.
2. run the program and choose encryption.
3. choose encrypt => encrypt file.
4. enter your file name for example (text.txt)
5. choose the algorithm and enter your secret key
	(If DES enter 8 characters)
	(If AES enter 16 or 24 or 32)
6. Encryption is done, and a new file will appear in the directory you picked

===============================================================================================


File Decryption
1. run the program and choose encryption.
2. choose decrypt => decrypt file.
3. enter your ENCRYPTED text file name for example (encrypted.txt)
4. choose the SAME algorithm and enter the SAME secret key
	(If DES enter 8 characters)
	(If AES enter 16 or 24 or 32)
5. Decryption is done, and a new DECRYPTED file will appear in the directory you picked

===============================================================================================

Folder Encryption
1. create a folder with text files inside in the directory you picked and name it.
2. compress the folder in a .zip file and name it.
3. run the program and choose encryption.
4. choose encrypt => encrypt folder.
5. enter your zipped folder name for example (folder.zip)
6. choose the algorithm and enter your secret key
	(if DES enter 8 characters)
	(if AES enter 16 or 24 or 32)
7. Encryption is done and a new zipped folder will apear in the directory you picked

===============================================================================================

Folder Decryption
1. run the program and choose encryption.
2. choose decrypt => decrypt folder.
3. enter your ENCRYPTED folder name for example (encrypted.zip)
4. choose the SAME algorithm and enter the SAME secret key
	(if DES enter 8 characters)
	(if AES enter 16 or 24 or 32)
5. Decryption is done and a new DECRYPTED file will appear in the directory you picked

===============================================================================================
Hashing 
1. create a text file in the directory you picked and name it.
2. run the program and choose hashing.
4. enter your file name for example (text.txt)
5. choose the algorithm
6. Hashing is done and a new file will appear in the directory you picked
